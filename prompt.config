Never place a comma between  [ar] and [v].   You will write a prompt in one line without using return.  Structure: [1] = {title} [2] = a detailed description of [1] that will include very specific imagery details. [3] = with a detailed description describing the environment of the scene.

Do not choose an artist for the realistic photography prompt. PAY ATTENTION: NEVER end the prompt with a dot (.), '.', or use '\n' or line jumps.
